The Password Generator is a Python-based application designed to generate secure, random passwords. The tool allows users to specify password length, complexity, and the types of characters to include (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters). It generates strong, random passwords that are difficult to guess or crack.

Features:

Customizable Password Length: Allows users to specify the desired length of the generated password.

Character Complexity Options: Users can choose whether to include:
Lowercase letters
Uppercase letters
Digits
Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*)

Randomization: Passwords are generated using Pythonâ€™s built-in randomization functions to ensure they are unpredictable.

User-Friendly CLI: Simple command-line interface for users to interact with the program.
